## Context 


this project ( being the famous project for workflow automation tool) can  also be  oriented to create the financial workflows  for the ethereum and defi . making them gamified for integrating the defi protocols ,  allowing the following possiblities :

### 1. Getting into collaboration between the diffrent DeFI projects for onchain collaboration :

currently the defi faces issues of  simplifying the complexicity of the 400+ [protocols in the ecosystem](https://snapshot.page) to  the more simplistic  drawing board kind of ecosystem . so my idea is to create the financial worflows of all the major protocols , then integrating with the project management and financial applications ecosystem .

## and further this will be stepping stone for another project , so stay tuned .
